PHPIDS component for CakePHP
------------------------------
PHPIDS (PHP-Intrusion Detection System) is a state-of-the-art security layer for your PHP based web application written by Mario Heiderich.

The IDS neither strips, sanitizes nor filters any malicious input, it simply recognizes when an attacker tries to break your site and reacts in exactly the way you want it to. PHPIDS is by far the best open source Intrusion Detection System for PHP right now. Don't forget to read its documentation to take full advantage of its power.(*)

INSTALLATION
------------------------------
1. Copy phpids_intrusion.php to your models folder (app/models)
2. Copy cakephpids.php to your components folder (app/controllers/components)
3. Copy phpids/ to your vendors folder (app/vendors)
3. Set up the database table where the intrusion alerts will be stored (Check phpids_intrusions.sql)
4. Configure the IDS settings (phpids/IDS/Config/Config.ini.php)
5. Include the component in the corresponding controllers or in your main app_controller.php if you wish to monitor all controllers. To improve performance we need to pass a list of functions to monitor (required).

var $components=array('Cakephpids'=>array(
                            'protectedActions'=>array('login','add','register','display')));
